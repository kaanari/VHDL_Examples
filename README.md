# Introduction

This is a helpful repository for who wants to learn VHDL design techniques.
You should find testbench files of all designs in the same directory.   

## Contents

+ [4 to 1 MUX](MUX4_TO_1): Basic Implementations ( Behavioral_V1 and Behavioral_V2 ) of Multiplexer. Tested on Nexys 4 Artix-7 FPGA Trainer Board.
+ [Counter](COUNTER): Basic Implementation of Counter by using Processes. Tested on Nexys 4 Artix-7 FPGA Trainer Board.
+ [Min-Max Calculator](MinMax): Basic Implementation of Min and Max Calculator of given 2 Numbers.  Tested on Nexys 4 Artix-7 FPGA Trainer Board.
+ [Finite State Machine](FSM):Basic Implementation of a Finite State Machine. Tested on Nexys 4 Artix-7 FPGA Trainer Board.
+ [1024x8 RAM Design](RAM1K8): Basic Implementation of 1024x8 RAM. In this design approach, LUTs inside the FPGAs won't configure themselves as a RAM. FPGAs will use built-in SRAM chips. Tested on Nexys 4 Artix-7 FPGA Trainer Board.
+ [Arithmetic Logic Unit](ALU): Basic Implementation of Arithmetic Logic Unit in VHDL. Tested on Nexys 4 Artix-7 FPGA Trainer Board.
